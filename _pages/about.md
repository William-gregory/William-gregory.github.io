About me
======
Welcome! I have a deep fascination with the processes that underlie weather and climate predictability. My research not only seeks to unravel these complex systems but also aims to enhance the safety, security, and well-being of communities worldwide. Understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena can significantly reduce the risks associated with extreme weather events, contributing to more resilient societies. Currently, I hold the position of Project Scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), where I am an active member of the Climate & Global Dynamics Group based in Boulder, CO.

In the past, I had the privilege of being an [ASP Post-Doctoral Fellow](https://asp.ucar.edu/postdocs/postdoctoral-fellowship-program) at NCAR, and concurrently, I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher contributing to the Multiscale Machine Learning ([M2lines](https://m2lines.github.io/)) In Coupled Earth System Modeling project (M2lines). My primary focus was to investigate regional climate model biases, leveraging data assimilation increments, and harnessing modern machine learning techniques to establish real-time/online corrections.

I earned my doctorate in Oceanography from the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/), where my research centered on enhancing the predictability of North American West Coast weather patterns using Deep Learning methodologies. Additionally, I delved into the theoretical aspects of weather predictability over extended time horizons via examining coupled (Ocean/atm) phenomena and the relavant teleconnections. My research interests also encompass post-processing of numerical weather predictions and leveraging large ensemble simulations to identify windows of opportunity for more accurate subseasonal forecasts. Presently, my work involves developing innovative strategies and methods to advance the predictability of extreme weather events at subseasonal timescales.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with my former advisors, including Dr. Shang-Ping Xie and Dr. Marty Ralph. Where, I was a proud part of the dedicated team at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, where our research contributes to a better understanding of weather and water-related phenomena in the western region.

Thank you for visiting my website and exploring my research endeavors!
