About me
======
Welcome! I'm a climate scientist interested in how artificial intelligence (AI) can advance our understanding and prediction capabilities of climate processes, particularly in the Earth's polar regions. My work so far has been multi-disciplinary; I have used to AI to improve remote sensing data sets over sea ice, as well as to build the first hybrid global sea ice model (see [Projects](https://william-gregory.github.io/projects/)).

My current focus is on sea ice emulation. Specifically, I am researching whether coupling a stand-alone sea ice emulator to pre-existing atmosphere and ocean emulators such as ACE and Samudra [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.12490](Duncan et al., 2025), improves the representation of coupled climate processes within the polar regions.

The AI techniques I use in my work include:
- Gaussian process models
- Convolutional neural networks
- Graph neural networks

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. Here, I am hired under the M2LInES initiative ([Multi-scale Machine Learning In coupled Earth System modeling](https://m2lines.github.io)), which is a programme dedicated to the improvement of climate model physics through novel machine learning techniques. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in polar climate and machine learning from University College London. For more information on my research activities, you can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zgcx9eQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

I am also developing a series of educational Python notebooks which cover the fundamental concepts of various statistical and ML methodologies. The aim is to cover concepts related to linear algebra, as well as supervised/unsupervised learning techniques; starting from linear regression and working towards deep neural networks. These notebooks will be routinely uploaded to the [Code](code) page of this website.
