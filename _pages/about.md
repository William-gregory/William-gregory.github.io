About me
======
Welcome! I am broadly interested in the processes that inform on weather and climate predictability. Currently, I am a PhD. Candidate at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) working on better understanding North American West Coast weather predictability with Deep Learning methods. I am particularly interested in numerical weather prediction post-processing, and using large ensemble simulations to inform forecast windows of opportunity. Currently I am working on schemes and methods to improve extreme weather event predictability at subseasonal timescales. I am advised by [Dr. Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), [Dr. Marty Ralph](https://mralph.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), and am a member of the [Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes](https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/).
