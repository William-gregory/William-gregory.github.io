# GPSat: Scalable Gaussian process interpolation

Satellite altimeters have been revolutionary in our understanding of sea ice, as they allow us to measure the thickness of the ice. Sea ice thickness plays a significant role in the sensitivity of sea ice to a given atmosphere or ocean perturbation (it takes more energy to melt thicker ice). Therefore, altimeters have given us a crucial window into sea ice volume budgets in the Arctic. Despite this, altimeters generally have narrow spatial footprints, on the order of 10s to 100s of metres. This means that on a given day, altimetry data may only sample a small fraction of a given spatial domain. For the CryoSat-2 radar altimeter, if data are binned to a 25 km grid, then it takes 30 days to uniformly sample the sea ice cover in the Arctic. At the footprint level it will take on the order of 1 year. These gaps in the data record make it difficult to understand how sea ice thickness changes on timescales ranging from days to weeks.

In this study we presented GPSat; an open-source Python programming library for performing efficient interpolation of non-stationary satellite altimetry data, using scalable Gaussian process techniques. We used GPSat to generate complete maps of daily 50 km-gridded Arctic sea ice radar freeboard, and found that, relative to a previous interpolation scheme, GPSat offers a 504Ã— computational speedup, with less than 4 mm difference on the derived freeboards on average. We then demonstrated the scalability of GPSat through freeboard interpolation at 5 km resolution, and Sea-Level Anomalies (SLA) at the resolution of the altimeter footprint. Interpolated 5 km radar freeboards showed strong agreement with airborne data (linear correlation of 0.66). Footprintlevel SLA interpolation also showed improvements in predictive skill over linear regression. In this work, we suggested that GPSat could overcome the computational bottlenecks faced in many altimetry-based interpolation routines, and hence advance critical understanding of ocean and sea ice variability over short spatio-temporal scales.
